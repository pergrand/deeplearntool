Grokking Deep Learning is the product of a monumental three years of effort.

>《深度学习图解》是我三年的不懈努力的成果。

To get to the book you hold in your hand, I wrote at least twice the number of pages you see here.

>为了完成你手中的这本书，我写的篇章至少你是看到的两倍。

Half-a-dozen chapters were rewritten from scratch three or four times before they were ready to publish,

>在发版之前，有一半的篇章被重写三四次。

and along the way important chapters were added that weren’t part of the original plan.

>并且，也增加了一些新的篇章。

More significantly, I arrived at two decisions early on that make Grokking Deep Learning uniquely valuable:

>更重要的，我很早就有的两个决定使这本书有独特的价值。

this book requires no math background beyond basic arithmetic, and it doesn’t rely on a high-level library that might hide what is going on.

>读这本书不需要有数学背景，不依赖已有的高级库。

In other words, anyone can read this book and understand how deep learning really works.

换而言之，任何人都可以读懂并且理解深度学习底层如何工作的。

To accomplish  this, I had to invent new ways to describe and teach the core ideas and techniques

>为了完成目标，我不得不独辟蹊径去描述核心思想和技术，

without falling back on advanced mathematics or sophisticated code that someone else wrote.

>而不依赖高级的数学公式和别人已完成的复杂的代码。

My goal in writing Grokking Deep Learning was to create the lowest possible barrier to entry to the practice of deep learning.

> 我写这本书的目的是尽量降低深度学习的门槛。

You don’t just read the theory; you’ll discover it yourself. To help you get there, To help you get there, I wrote a lot of code and did my best to explain it in the right order so that the code snippets required for the working demosall made sense.

>你不仅仅要学习理论，也应该更深入的探索。为了帮助你，我尽我所能写了大量代码解释，书中演示的代码都容易理解。
