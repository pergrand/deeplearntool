> 《深度学习图解》是我三年的不懈努力的成果。
To get to the book you hold in your hand, I wrote at least twice the number of pages you see here.
>为了完成你手中的这本书，我写的篇章至少你是看到的两倍。
Half-a-dozen chapters were rewritten from scratch three or four times before they were ready to publish,
>在发版之前，有一半的篇章被重写三四次。
and along the way important chapters were added that weren’t part of the original plan.
>并且，也增加了一些新的篇章。
